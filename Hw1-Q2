/*
-We have to add semicolons after the variable integer1 and integer2 after that we have to change the variable 
‘’ x ‘’ (int x) as the variable ‘’ sum ‘’ (int sum) because we assign the total sum as the variable ‘’sum ‘’. 
The last change on the code is the missing double quotes in the first printf part. 
We have to use double quotes to make the prompt readable.
